Great product. Have been using it for more than 1.5 years now. No issues, no hanging problem. Battery life is same as on day one. Each of their products is just awesome.+1
The protection level is poor. My phone fell off the table onto a flat floor while it was in this case and my tempered glass screen protector cracked.+-1
Love the blue bumper case.+1
This is a great band! Never used one before buying this but I tried out a couple of other bands once I had this wrapped around my wrist and my take is - heavy VFM !+1
